 - Try to do this in TTD
 - Add a TodoItem
   - Explanation
   - Priority
   - Deadline
   - IsCompleted
 - Add the List for TodoItems. Initially stored in app memory
 - Methods for adding, editing, deleting and marking as done/undone.
 - Store in MariaDB
   - Preferably dockerized
   - Can I test this with dockerized test-db?
     - No, I should mock the db

DB:
 - Keep it simple for now, no user id's or anything
 |                            TodoItems                           |
 | id | explanation | priority | deadline | isCompleted | deleted |
 | ?? |    String   |  tinyint |   Date   |   boolean   |   date  |

 - Add item
   - INSERT INTO TodoItems (explanation, priority, deadline, isCompleted) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4)
 - Edit item (by id!)
   - UPDATE TodoItems SET explanation = '$1', priority = '$2', deadline = '$3', isCompleted = '$4' WHERE id = $id
 - remove item, set date to deleted and then remove when some time has passed, on week maybe?
   - UPDATE TodoItems SET deleted = true WHERE id = $id
 - toggle completed status
   - UPDATE TodoItems SET isCompleted = !isCompleted
 - And finally, simple query.
   - Select explanation, priority, deadline, isCompleted from TodoItems WHERE NOT deleted;
