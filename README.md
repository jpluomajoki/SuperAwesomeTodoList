# SuperAwesomeTodoList
Simple Todo list implemented in Java. 

As of now, this is WIP. Most of the boilerplate and basic class structure is initially done. User interface does not yet exist, and the only way to actually use any of the functionalities is via JUnit tests.

MariaDB is used for database, running in docker container. DB can be launched with `docker-compose up` from project root. Eventually the whole project would be started using docker, but that would be one of the last features to be implemented.

Used interface would be a web service which returns JSON values.
